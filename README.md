# Shortcut Hotkey Exploitation
This repository contains the POC and the scanner to catch the Shortcut Hotkey Exploitation method.                                                                                                                    
                                                       
# Explanation
The method exploits a 'feature' in windows shortcut (links) mechanism - specifically the attribute Hotkey.                                                                 
The attribute allows to add a shortcut key in the keyboard and assign it to the shortcut file. Manually, for every key that will be assigned to the shortcut file Ctrl and Alt will append to it. The POC provides a way to override it and therefore every keystorke can run a file / malicious code.
